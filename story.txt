A man wakes up in an apartment bed, dazed with a massive headache. He slowly rises and gazes out the window, seeing empty streets and broken windows. "What happened?" he muttered as he walks out of the apartment.

He clutched the strap of his backpack and stared down at his scuffed Red Wing boots that had been with him for the past decade. His laces were coming undone so he stopped to tighten them. When he bent over, a pack of hand rolled cigarettes fell from his flannel pocket and littered the sidewalk. Odd he thought. He hadn't smoked a day in his life. One of the cigarettes had what appeared to be a faint message written on the inside. He picked it up and began to unroll it. "608-214-4567 2/29/20 7:15PM."

He quickly looked to his wrist. His watch was gone! His heart sank. His silver timeX watch had been an extiention of his body for years. He couldn't even remember the last time he had taken it off. No time, he thought. Rushing in to a coffee shop he began searching for a clock, 6:45, stopped. He ran to the counter requesting the phone. He needed to make a call. 

Realizing he was doing this out of habit the man turns and begins looking aorund the once familiar building. The shop was covered in a thick layer of dust with broken glass still scattered around. The man begins to leave when he notices light bouncing off something in the back. In front of the large industrial freezer was his watch. Around the watch were footprints clearly visible in the thick dust, and one long track from when the door had been opened.
